Gamma correction is used to correct for the nonlinear relationship between luminance and brightness.

This small application produces a Lookup Table (LUT) with the PWM duty cycles which are gamma corrected to produce linear brightness changes. 



## Background
When an LED emits light, gamma correction is used to account for the power-law relationship between luminance and brightness. Although often used interchangeably, luminance and brightness are not synonyms.
>
> Luminance: The emitted light, projected per unit area measured in cd/m² (candela/ meter²).
> 
> Brightness: The perceived luminance attributed by the human eye.
